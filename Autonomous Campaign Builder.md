# 🚀 Autonomous Campaign Builder
This project is an AI-powered system that transforms a marketing goal into a complete, ready-to-launch campaign plan using a series of intelligent LangGraph agents. Each agent specializes in a specific marketing function—from market research to content creation, audience segmentation, simulation, and email outreach.

Powered by LangChain, LangGraph, ChromaDB, and Gemini Pro, the system ensures every decision is grounded in data and optimized for performance.

## 📌 Objective

To build an intelligent, end-to-end system that:

- Understands high-level business goals (e.g., “Increase SUV sales in South-West”).
- Analyzes past sales, customer, and campaign data using semantic search.
- Segments target audiences automatically.
- Suggests marketing strategies and generates content.
- Simulates campaign performance and exports a structured plan.

### 📦 Installation

Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy>=1.24.0
pip install pandas>=2.0.0
pip install langchain>=0.1.0
pip install langchain-community>=0.0.10
pip install langchain-core>=0.1.0

## Datasets Used:
customer.csv → Contains details like customer ID, region, gender, preferences, etc.

sales.csv → Information on products sold, purchase dates, and regions.

marketing_campaign.csv → Past campaign types, communication channels, and outcomes.

## Data Chunking & Embedding Strategy
Each row from the dataset is transformed into a sentence using Python string formatting. These chunks make it easier for the model to semantically understand and embed the information.
 Example:
Original Row:
customer_id,region,gender,car_preference
C101,North,Female,SUV
Chunked Sentence:
"Customer C101 from North region is a Female who prefers SUV."

Embedding and Vector Storage:
These generated sentences are embedded using Google’s textembedding-gecko-004 model, which converts them into high-dimensional vectors. This allows similarity search and reasoning across related pieces of information.

These text chunks are embedded using Google’s textembedding-gecko-004 model and stored in ChromaDB collections:
customer_data
sales_data
campaign_data

## Project Workflow Overview
🔄 Goal-to-Campaign Flow
1.	Input: A business goal (e.g., "Boost SUV sales in South-West")
2.	Agent Workflow: Managed by LangGraph to process the goal through these stages:

| Agent Name               | Responsibility                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `create_campaign_strategy` | Creates campaign structure: name, timeline, channels, KPIs, messaging         |
| `generate_content`         | Crafts content for email, social, and landing pages                          |
| `generate_final_report`    | Compiles all generated assets into a detailed campaign report                 |
| `research_market_trends`   | Uses Tavily + internal data to generate market and trend analysis             |
| `segment_audience`         | Selects ideal primary and secondary audience segments based on goal and insights |
| `send_emails`              | Sends personalized marketing emails to target customers                      |
| `simulate_campaign`        | Predicts campaign performance: reach, engagement, conversions, ROI, risks    |



3.	Context: Each agent uses relevant data from ChromaDB, powered by semantic search.


## Agent Workflow & Architecture
The project follows a Goal-to-Campaign Flow powered by LangChain and LangGraph. Each goal is processed through a sequence of intelligent agents, with decisions enhanced by semantic search using ChromaDB and Google embeddings.
